I made some progress on my [experimental blog](https://github.com/wastegas/blog) project, new articles can now be added. Doing some styling with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) on it too. I also added [Jade](https://github.com/digitaltoad/vim-jade) and [Stylus](https://github.com/wavded/vim-stylus) syntax highlighting to [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) since I'll be spending a lot of time with these files.

I'll spend some time doing more tweaking on this [Github page](https://github.com/wastegas/wastegas.github.io) too and get more familiar with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
