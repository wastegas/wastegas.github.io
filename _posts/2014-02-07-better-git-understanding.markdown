I spent some time reading [Ry's Git Tutorial](http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/index.html) which I found very useful to me. It improved my understanding of the Git workflow and was able to beyond my usual habit of just commits and pushes to master.

I'll definitly start to making use of [branching](http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/branches-1.html) and creating tags to take snapshots of milestones points in projects.

If you're new to Git, I highly recommend it. There's a lot of tutorials out there that you can check out too but I found this tutorial the easiest to understand Git. But again, that's just me. :)

Happy coding!
