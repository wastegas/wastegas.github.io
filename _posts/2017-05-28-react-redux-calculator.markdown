It's been a while since I posted something here. This is the usual neglected repository. But anyway, I convinced myself to understand [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). What better way, than to create a project. I chose to do a [Simple Calculator](https://wastegas.github.io/calculator) which was something not too overly complicated but still challenging enough. This great post on [How to set Webpack 2.0 from scratch](https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies/easy-guide-for-webpack-2-0-from-scratch-fe508a3ce44e) helped alot in getting my webpack configuration going so I can focus on my actual project. The project also included testing using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). I'll continue to make improvements to this as time permits. The calculation currently uses [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) but I'm looking at implementing [Shunting-yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) algorithm instead. This will be good mini-project for this.
