Updated [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/) to the latest version due to vulnerabilities of the older version. Of course that broke my [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/) because of the new syntax. I'll fix it when I have time. I might even redo the style.
