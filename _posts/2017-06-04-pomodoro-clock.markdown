Just finished [Pomodoro Clock](https://wastegas.github.io/pomodoro) which is also known as a [tomato timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). It's used as a time management tool when you're working on a project so you don't get carried away and forget to take breaks.

This was a fun project to do. I figured out how to get [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [font awesome](https://fontawesome.io/) integrated with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

As usual, the source is on [github](https://github.com/wastegas/pomodoro-clock).
